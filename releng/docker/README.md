This directory contains stuff related to generating and running docker images. It's not that it's a zzbot need, but I needed to experiment with docker and kubernetes as part of my job, and I took running zzbot as an example.

To start image and launch a shell within it: `docker run -it zzbot:1.0 /bin/bash`
